# To-Do list using Blazor


It's simple to-do list with use of server-side [*Blazor*](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/apps/aspnet/web-apps/blazor) framework, with a little bit of JavaScript interpos. Since I`ve seen [*Mircosoft To-Do*](https://to-do.microsoft.com/pl-pl) app I've wanted to recreate this myself someday. That's why it looks similarly(some things have been simplified), but there is no point to improve something amazing! :relaxed:
